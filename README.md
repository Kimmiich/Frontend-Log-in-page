# NEWSLETTER - FRONTEND

This is the frontend part of an exercise within the course dynamic web development.

## Background

In this project we’re asked to build a frontend where a user can create an account and choose to subscribe to a newsletter or not.

The user should also be able to log in to their account and change the subscription status. This part of the project should be coded with headless principles.

## Launch demo

The frontend is provided through github pages and can be tested [here](gör till länk)

### Existing users and passwords:

| Name   | Password |
| ------ | -------- |
| Kimmie | test     |
| Janne  | testtest |

## Installation

> Feel free to clone this repo and look at it locally.

I recommend using **VS code**, there you can use the live-server option too see local changes etc.
